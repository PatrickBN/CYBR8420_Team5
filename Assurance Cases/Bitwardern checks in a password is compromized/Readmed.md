# Assurance Claim 1: Bitwarden checks if passwords have been in data breaches using Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) database


# Assurance: This feature gives users proactive alerts to change compromised passwords, further securing their online accounts.

### Summary
The Data Breach reports identify compromised data (email addresses, passwords, credit cards, DoB, and more) in known breaches, using a service called Have I Been Pwned (HIBP). Bitwarden uses the same HIBP database to check if  any of the stored passwords have appeared in data breaches. Users are alerted and prompted to update their password if any matches are found in the HIBP database
