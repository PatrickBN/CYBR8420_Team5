# Assurance Claim 1: BitWarden Secures Credit Card Payment Information
[Back to Assurance Cases](https://github.com/PatrickBN/CYBR8420_Team5/blob/main/Assurance%20Cases.md)

### Summary

This assurance case demonstrates that the system, which manages company credit cards through BitWarden, provides robust security mechanisms, including Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), encryption, and network monitoring, to mitigate risks from both internal and external threats. However, several potential vulnerabilities challenge the completeness of this claim. These include human error, sophisticated attacks that bypass defenses, insider threats, and physical risks like lost credit cards. Additionally, compliance with security standards does not guarantee total protection. Overall, while the system offers substantial safeguards, the assurance case acknowledges that certain risks, especially those involving human factors and unforeseen vulnerabilities, remain critical challenges to address.
