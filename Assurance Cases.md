# Assurance Cases

### Assurance Cases and Summaries

  1. Tobias Lathrop - [BitWarden minimizes unauthorized users](https://github.com/PatrickBN/CYBR8420_Team5/blob/main/Assurance%20Cases/BitWarden%20minimizes%20unauthorized%20users/BitWarden%20minimizes%20unauthorized%20users%20Readme.md)

     Summary: In order for the employees to logon into the hypothetical operating enivronment system they must use the BitWarden OSS. This requires each employee to go through authorization, because of the need to ensure proper authorization, assurance is required to mitigate the doubts about BitWardens ability to provide trustworthy user authentication.

Conner Braley - [BitWarden Uses Secrets to ensure code is protected from unauthorized access](https://github.com/PatrickBN/CYBR8420_Team5/blob/main/Assurance%20Cases/Bitwarden%20Using%20Secrets%20To%20Ensure%20Code%20Is%20Protected/BitWarden%20Using%20Secrets%20to%20Ensure%20Code%20is%20Protected%20Readme.md)

     Summary: In our hypothetical environment, using BitWardens secret manager is needed to protect our public facing systems, and our internal resources. It provides strong encryption, which makes sure that sensitive data are protected during storage and transit. This protects us against potential breaches. Access to the secrets is restricted to authorized personnel. Bitwarden also allows centralized management through a secure admin console, making it easy to manage staff access. The system also makes sure their is regular rotation of secrets, minimizing the risk of compramised credentials. Finally, it maintains secure logs for accountability. This allows us to operate confidently, knowing our data and systems are protected from unauthorized access and vulnerabilities.
