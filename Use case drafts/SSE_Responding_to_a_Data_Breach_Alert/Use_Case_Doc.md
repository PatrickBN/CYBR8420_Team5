**Use Case Description:**<br>
Bitwarden identifies that a password stored in the vault has been compromised in a known data breach. The user receives a notification, logs in to Bitwarden, and updates the breached password, which is then securely saved in the vault.
Preconditions: The user's credentials were involved in a breach and tied to a known service.
Postconditions: The compromised password is updated, and the user's accounts are now secured.

Analysis:

Security Requirements:
For Bitwarden's Responding to a Data Breach Alert scenario, the following security measures are critical to maintaining the system's protection and safeguarding user data.

1. Breach Detection Security
Bitwarden must use trusted breach detection services and secure protocols to identify compromised credentials.

2. Data Encryption
All user credentials must be encrypted with strong algorithms both in transit and at rest to protect against unauthorized access.

3. Secure Breach Notifications
Breach notifications must be securely delivered and authenticated to prevent phishing or tampering.

4. User Authentication
Users must authenticate with strong methods before viewing or changing breached passwords.

5. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
Enforcing two-factor authentication (2FA) adds extra security when responding to breach alerts.

6. Credential Re-Evaluation
Bitwarden should automatically evaluate other stored credentials for reuse of breached passwords and alert users if found.

7. Secure Password Update
Users should be guided to update compromised passwords with strong alternatives that are securely stored and synchronized.

8. Audit Logging
All breach-related actions must be securely logged and auditable to detect any unauthorized activity.

9. Rate Limiting and Monitoring
Bitwarden should implement rate limiting and monitor unusual activity after breach alerts to prevent further attacks.

10. User Guidance
Clear instructions on breach response, password updates, and phishing prevention must be provided to users.

11. Minimal Data Exposure
Breach notifications should only expose the necessary information to avoid leaking sensitive data.

12. Timely Breach Alerts
Breach alerts must be delivered promptly, and users should be immediately prompted to update compromised credentials.

13. Endpoint Security
Bitwarden must ensure that user devices and software are secure and resistant to tampering.
