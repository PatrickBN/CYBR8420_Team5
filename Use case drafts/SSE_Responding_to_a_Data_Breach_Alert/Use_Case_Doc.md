**Use Case Description:**<br>
Bitwarden identifies that a password stored in the vault has been compromised in a known data breach. The user receives a notification, logs in to Bitwarden, and updates the breached password, which is then securely saved in the vault.
Preconditions: The user's credentials were involved in a breach and tied to a known service.
Postconditions: The compromised password is updated, and the user's accounts are now secured.

**Analysis:**<br>

**Security Requirements:**<br>
For Bitwarden's Responding to a Data Breach Alert scenario, the following security measures are critical to maintaining the system's protection and safeguarding user data.

**1. Breach Detection Security**<br>
Bitwarden must use trusted breach detection services and secure protocols to identify compromised credentials.

**2. Data Encryption**<br>
All user credentials must be encrypted with strong algorithms both in transit and at rest to protect against unauthorized access.

**3. Secure Breach Notifications**<br>
Breach notifications must be securely delivered and authenticated to prevent phishing or tampering.

**4. User Authentication**<br>
Users must authenticate with strong methods before viewing or changing breached passwords.

**5. Two-Factor Authentication**<br>
Enforcing two-factor authentication (2FA) adds extra security when responding to breach alerts.

**6. Credential Re-Evaluation**<br>
Bitwarden should automatically evaluate other stored credentials for reuse of breached passwords and alert users if found.

**7. Secure Password Update**<br>
Users should be guided to update compromised passwords with strong alternatives that are securely stored and synchronized.

**8. Audit Logging**<br>
All breach-related actions must be securely logged and auditable to detect any unauthorized activity.

**9. Rate Limiting and Monitoring**<br>
Bitwarden should implement rate limiting and monitor unusual activity after breach alerts to prevent further attacks.

**10. User Guidance**<br>
Clear instructions on breach response, password updates, and phishing prevention must be provided to users.

**11. Minimal Data Exposure**<br>
Breach notifications should only expose the necessary information to avoid leaking sensitive data.

**12. Timely Breach Alerts**<br>
Breach alerts must be delivered promptly, and users should be immediately prompted to update compromised credentials.

**13. Endpoint Security**<br>
Bitwarden must ensure that user devices and software are secure and resistant to tampering.
